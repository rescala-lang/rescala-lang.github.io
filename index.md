REScala is a Scala library for functional reactive programming on the JVM and the Web.
It provides a rich API for event stream transformations and signal composition
with managed consistent up-to-date state and minimal syntactic overhead.
It supports concurrent and distributed programs.

## Flexible

Abstractions for Events and Signals. Integrating with imperative, object-oriented, functional and any other paradigm on the JVM.

</div><div class="col-sm-4">

## Consistent

No temporary inconsistencies, no data races, no surprises.
Write code which behaves as expected.

</div><div class="col-sm-4">

## Thread-safe

Multi-threaded applications are fully supported.
Reactive abstractions can be safely accessed from any thread and they are updated in parallel.

## Project Description

Software applications react to external changes such as the input from the user and network messages.
Traditionally, object-oriented software adopts the Observer pattern to implement reactivity and decouple the observers from the observables.
Whereas researchers have highlighted the drawbacks of this style for a long time, alternatives struggle to be widely accepted.
In particular, functional reactive programming and dataflow programming – which aim to represent time-changing values as first class abstractions – are promising,
but hardly escape the functional setting. On the other hand, event-based languages directly support events but do not achieve the declarative style of more functional approaches.


REScala is a reactive language which integrates concepts from event-based and functional-reactive programming into the object-oriented world.
Rescala supports the development of reactive applications by fostering a functional and declarative style which complements the advantages of object-oriented design.
