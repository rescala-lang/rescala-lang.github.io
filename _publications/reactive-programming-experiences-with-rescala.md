name: "Reactive programming experience with REScala"
abstract: "Reactive programming is a recent programming paradigm that specifically targets reactive applications. Over the years, a number of reactive languages have been proposed, with different combinations of features, and various target domains.

Unfortunately, there is a lack of knowledge about the experience of developing software applications with reactive languages. As a result, a number of design choices in reactive programming languages remain disconnected from experience and the applicability of reactive programming to various domains remains unclear.

To bridge this gap, we report on our experience of developing reactive applications as well as teaching reactive programming in REScala, which we collected over several years of research and practice."
