name: "Fault-tolerant Distributed Reactive Programming"
abstract: "We present a holistic approach to provide fault tolerance for distributed reactiveprogramming. Our solution automatically stores and recovers program state to handle crashes,automatically updates and shares distributed parts of the state to provide eventual consistency,and handles errors in a fine-grained manner to allow precise manual control when necessary.By making use of the reactive programming paradigm, we provide these mechanisms withoutchanging the behavior of existing programs and with reasonable performance, as indicated byour experimental evaluatio"
