name: "JEScala: Modular Coordination with Declarative Events and Joins"
abstract: "Advanced concurrency abstractions overcome the drawbacks of low-level techniques such as locks and monitors, freeing programmers that implement concurrent applications from the burden of concentrating on low-level details. However, with current approaches the coordination logic involved in complex coordination schemas is fragmented into several pieces including join patterns, data emissions triggered in different places of the application, and the application logic that implicitly creates dependencies among communication channels, hence indirectly among join patterns. We present JEScala, a language that captures coordination schemas in a more expressive and modular way by leveraging a seamless integration of an advanced event system with join abstractions. We validate our approach with case studies and provide a first performance assessment."
