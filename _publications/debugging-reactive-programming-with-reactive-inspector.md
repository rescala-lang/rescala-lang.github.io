name: "Debugging Reactive Programming with Reactive Inspector"
abstract: "Reactive programming provides dedicated language abstractions for reactive software, relieving developers from manually updating outputs when the inputs of a computation change. Unfortunately, complementing the new paradigm with proper tools that support coding activities is a vastly unexplored area.

We investigate a primary issue in the field: debugging programs in the reactive style. We propose RP Debugging, a methodology for effectively debugging reactive programs. These ideas are implemented in Reactive Inspector, a debugger for reactive programs integrated with the Eclipse Scala development environment."
