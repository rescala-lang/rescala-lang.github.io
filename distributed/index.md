# Distributed REScala - SID-UP 
Distributed REScala is the first language to bring Reactive Programming to the distributed setting. It is build around SID-UP (short for Source IDentifier Update Propagation), an update propagation algorithm that supports the full feature set of Reactive Programming extended to cover Remote Reactives â€“ Reactives that can be shared with and used transparently on remote hosts. SID-UP was designed with distribution in mind, minimizing the amount of coordination and remote communication required to execute glitch-free update turns for distributed reactive applications.
