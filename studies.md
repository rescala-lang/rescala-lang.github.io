# React Shapes


![Shapes](images/shapes.png){: width="480" height="280"}
ReactShapes is a small drawing program. The user can drag and drop
different shapes on a canvas, connect them with
lines and change the stroke width and the color of
each shape.
The application supports a history with undo.
Finally, the drawing canvas can be shared with
other clients that participate in the same task from
remote.

# Universe

![Universe](images/universe.png){: width="420" height="280"}

Universe is a program that simulates a 2D
environment. The environment is populated by animals and plants; the
simulation involves growing of animals and plants, movements of
animals, and planning for food search.

The simulation evolves in rounds and the state of each
element at a given step is a function of the other
elements and of the state of the simulation in the
previous step. This structure allows one to express
several aspects of the computation functionally. However,
the elements of the simulation are mutable objects that
encapsulate state, so the OO and the functional style must
be properly combined.
