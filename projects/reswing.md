# The RESwing Library

The RESwing library is a reactive graphic library that
easies the development of reactive applications using
Rescala.

RESwing provides components that interface with reactive
abstractions like signals and events. This way developers
do not need to implement boilerplate code to connect
signal-based applications with a graphic interface.

RESwing is based on the Scala Swing library and it is
compatible with Java Swing.

RESwing has been originally contributed by Pascal
Weisenburger an is now used in most of the Rescala projects
with a GUI.
