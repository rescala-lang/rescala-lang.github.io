# Contributing

This branch/folder contains the sources of the REScala website: www.rescala-lang.com


It is a github pages site and converting from the source to HTML is managed on the server side, see https://pages.github.com/ for all details.

In short, Github pages are generated with https://jekyllrb.com/ where we use markdown for generating the content,
to edit any of the basic pages just modify any of the markdown files and push your changes.
