title: "RESwing Case Studies"
description: "A GUI library based on the Swing Java library which provides bindings for REScala i.e., the widgets expose reactive abstractions (signals and events) to the rest of the application.

RESwing has multiple case studies including a shape drawing application, a RSS reader, a texteditor, and a small turn based game."
