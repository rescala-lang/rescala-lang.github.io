# RPeclipse Plugin

Reactive programming relives developers from manually
updating outputs when the inputs of a computation change, it overcomes
a number of well-known issues of the Observer design pattern, and it
makes pro grams more comprehensible.

Unfortunately, complementing the
new paradigm with proper tools that support coding activities is a
vastly unexplored area. Hence, as of now, developers can embrace
reactive programming only at the cost of a more challenging
development process.

In this project, we investigate a primary issue in the
field: debugging programs in the reactive style. We analyze the
problem of debugging reactive programs, show that the reactive style
requires a paradigm shift in the concepts needed for debugging, and
propose RP Debugging, a methodology for effectively debugging reactive
programs. These ideas are implemented in RPeclipse, a debugger for
reactive programs integrated with the Eclipse Scala development
environment.
